{"name":"guide.js","tagline":"Elegant, interactive, and flexible JavaScript user tutorial library.","body":"guide.js\r\n========\r\n\r\nElegant, interactive, and dynamic JavaScript user guiding and tutorial library.\r\n\r\nThis library started out as a fork of [pageguide.js](https://github.com/tracelytics/pageguide), but ended up being its own package as the code\r\ndiverged too much from the original codebase.\r\n\r\nIf `guide.js` doesn't fit your needs, take a look at [pageguide.js](https://github.com/tracelytics/pageguide), or see the Related appendix below for more options.\r\n\r\n## What makes it different\r\n\r\n* Deeply customizable and flexible in order to support most DOM structures\r\n* Responsive design support\r\n* i18n and RTL language support\r\n* Multiple Tours: each with its own sequence of steps\r\n* Single-page-apps support through [tours](#tours)\r\n* Multiple content sources; create tours and their steps using JavaScript and JSON, inline markup (using `data-guide` attributes), or by using explicit HTML elements to hold the content\r\n* Dynamic; add and remove tour steps at run-time\r\n* Modular, extensible: pick and use what you want\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (1.10.2+ or 2.0.2+)\r\n* [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) (or [lodash](http://lodash.com))\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nInclude the minified guide.js JavaScript file:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"https://github.com/amireh/guide.js/dist/guide.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can start defining tours. See the bundled examples for getting started.\r\n\r\n## Browser compatibility\r\n\r\nThe library has been tested on Linux and Windows variants of the following browsers:\r\n\r\n* IE 9 (Windows)\r\n* Chrome 28\r\n* Firefox 22\r\n* Opera 12\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\nguide.js can support extra functionality via extensions, allowing you to pick and load only the features that you need.\r\n\r\nEnabling an extension is as simple as including its JS script. Some extensions may require configuration, others simply add themselves as functionality layers.\r\n\r\nSee `src/extensions/` for the available stock extensions guide.js ships with.\r\n\r\n### Stock extensions\r\n\r\n**The Tutor**\r\n\r\nDisplay tour entries in a single static element. The tutor will update its content as the user takes the tour and allows the user to navigate around it.\r\n\r\n**Markers**\r\n\r\nAttach 'guidelets' to DOM elements to display tour entries in-place. Each guidelet will display the tour entry position, and when clicked will (optionally) expand with the content of the entry.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n**JS**\r\n\r\nguide.js can be built using the require.js optimizer and minifies code using `uglifyjs`,\r\nwhich you can install using the node package manager:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install r.js\r\nnpm install uglify-js\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have `r.js` installed, launch a terminal and do the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /path/to/guide.js/src/js\r\nr.js -o build.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will now find the minified JavaScript in `dist/guide.js`.\r\n\r\nYou can customize the build profile, in `src/js/build.js`, to your liking to\r\ninclude or exclude some guide.js extras.\r\n\r\n**CSS**\r\n\r\nTo build the stylesheet, you need the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) compiler:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /path/to/guide.js\r\nlessc --strict-imports --compress src/guide.less dist/guide.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Linux (or you have `inotify-tools` available), you can use a compiler script which will automatically listen to changes made to the source LESS file `guide.less` and produce a built version in `dist/guide.css`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /path/to/guide.js/src/css\r\n./compiler.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\nHere's a list of related libraries I've used before writing `guide.js`. They are\r\nall about providing a 'tour' or 'guide' for users, but they differ in how they\r\nimplement markers, content feeding, and other things.\r\n\r\n* [pageguide.js](http://tracelytics.github.io/pageguide/)\r\n* [intro.js](http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/)\r\n* [Trip.js](http://eragonj.github.io/Trip.js/)\r\n* [aSimpleTour](http://alvaroveliz.github.io/aSimpleTour/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nguide.js is developed by [Algol Labs](www.algollabs.com) and is licensed under\r\nthe MIT terms.
